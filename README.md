An edited version of original beslist-xml feed plugin.
You can download original plugin at: https://wordpress.org/plugins/beslist-xml-feed-voor-woocommerce/

What I've changed:

 - You can get XML feeds by category (with your helps, obviously)
 - You can see gallery images for woocommerce product in XML file.
 - You can see short & full description for every products
 - You can show your default currency by changing `<kur>USD</kur>`
 - You can view all XML feeds via wordpress admin panel.

I'm not a coder, so I don't know much about security, If you notice any security open in this plugin, please let me know.
